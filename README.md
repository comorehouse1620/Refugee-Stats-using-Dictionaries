# Lab 5 â€“ Refugee Stats using Dictionaries
## Summarize what your script does or the problem you were trying to solve.
My script creates a dictionary called refugees and then uses three functions to loop through and print country names, populations of the refugee camps in those countries, and then print out each country name and how many refugees are in that countries' camps.
## Summarize any major errors you encountered and what sources they used to resolve the errors
My main error at the end was I tried to concatenate integers with strings in the print statement in my final function. 
## How you fixed the errors, or where the error is if you couldn't figure something out.
I googled how to change the type from integer to string, so I new how to format it correctly. I used this link: https://www.journaldev.com/23642/python-concatenate-string-and-int
